"are are correlated. X. One and x is correlated, that there's there's effects between column, and the other you will write plus x, column x, , and and in the generalizing your model library will automatically for interactions between X, and x . So it does all of that for you, and you don't have to do that.",where you that there's stock price that moves,I didn't even put in a public
that column is a function of the mean of the other column.,and you you! You get your results,"What we're doing is removing random values and putting them from moving them into the testing data set. And then we're adding these values back . So what are we doing? These values are all very close values to other values, but before and behind it, ?"

Then you can really learn any plane because you have the foundations.,And then we we what the data set looks like.,"And you That's a very simple, univariate ? They typically and you have an excel spreadsheet. You have variables, as dimensions. It's a tougher, but you we you can think of it conceptually as just dimension."

a uniform probability distribution .,and i'll you all next week.,"what if the data is not continues. So that's not. That's not a good question. The The data is never continuous, because it's just a bunch of data points, something that's continuous as a function. Data is never continues. A function is continuous, ?

Why is it important Because it describes the long-term behavior. System?,"we have ,","Um, and . So these are the main characters me that my red army was led by Mao, and I can. What I can do is I can take. Now that I what the important names is. I can create a a time series,"
