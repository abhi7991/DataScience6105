# NLP - Analaysis of Zoom transcripts

## Overview
For my Data Science class final project I worked with a team of 3 to analyse texts. For this project we took an input dataset of all the Zoom transcripts from out professors lecture and analyste them using the following models

1. Computational - BERT
2. Semantic - KMedoids
3. Network - PageRank

## Results
We were able to build models using the above tools to obtain results which included simple analysis like most used works to complex insights like obtaining synopsis of all important topics and concepts which our professor taught us through the semester

There are 3 notebooks which can be loaded onto Jupyter to view the results
